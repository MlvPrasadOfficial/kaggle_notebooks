Here are the key steps to utilize GPUs with PyTorch:\n","\n","#### **Device selection**: PyTorch provides the torch.device object, which allows you to specify the device (e.g., CPU or GPU) on which tensors and models will be allocated. By default, tensors and models are allocated on the CPU. You can move them to a GPU by calling the to method, passing a torch.device object or a string representation of the device (e.g., 'cuda').\n","\n","#### **GPU availability check**: You can check if a GPU is available using the torch.cuda.is_available() function. This is useful when your code needs to handle cases where a GPU is not present.\n","\n","#### **Data transfer to GPU**: Before feeding data into a model, you need to transfer the data tensors to the GPU memory. Use the to method to move tensors to the GPU: input_tensor = input_tensor.to(device).\n","\n","#### **Model allocation on GPU**: Similarly, you can move the model to the GPU by calling the to method: model = model.to(device). This ensures that both the model parameters and the input data reside on the same device.\n","\n","#### **GPU-accelerated operations**: PyTorch automatically dispatches operations to the GPU when both operands are on the GPU. This allows you to perform tensor operations and computations on the GPU without explicit device management.\n","\n","## 14.2 Data parallelism and distributed training\n","#### PyTorch provides features for scaling up training on multiple GPUs or even multiple machines in a distributed setup. Two commonly used techniques for distributed training are data parallelism and model parallelism.\n","\n","#### **Data parallelism**: Data parallelism is the process of splitting the mini-batch of training data across multiple GPUs, performing forward and backward computations on each GPU independently, and aggregating the gradients to update the model parameters. PyTorch simplifies data parallelism through the torch.nn.DataParallel wrapper. By wrapping a model with DataParallel, PyTorch automatically splits the mini-batch and performs parallel computations across multiple GPUs.\n","\n","#### **Model parallelism**: Model parallelism is used when a single GPU does not have enough memory to fit the entire model. In model parallelism, different parts of the model are placed on different GPUs, and computations are coordinated across GPUs during forward and backward passes. PyTorch provides tools, such as torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel, to handle model parallelism ina distributed training setup. With DistributedDataParallel, you can distribute the model across multiple GPUs or machines and synchronize the gradients during training.\n","\n","#### To utilize data parallelism or distributed training in PyTorch, you typically need to set up a distributed environment, such as using torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel or a distributed training framework like PyTorch Lightning or Horovod. These frameworks handle the communication and coordination between different processes or GPUs, allowing you to focus on defining the model and training loop.\n","\n","<h1 align=\"left\"><font color='red'>15</font></h1>\n","\n","# Chapter 15: PyTorch and ONNX\n","## 15.1 Introduction to ONNX\n","#### ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open format for representing machine learning models that allows interoperability between different frameworks.
