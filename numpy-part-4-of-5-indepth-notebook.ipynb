    "## 61.2 Loading Images:\n",
    "### NumPy provides the numpy.imread() function to load images from various file formats, including JPEG, PNG, and BMP. This function returns a NumPy array representing the image, where each element corresponds to a pixel value. The image can be loaded in color or grayscale mode, depending on the specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 61.3 Displaying Images:\n",
    "### To display the loaded image using NumPy, we can utilize the Matplotlib library. The pyplot.imshow() function from Matplotlib can be used to visualize the NumPy array representing the image. This function accepts the NumPy array as input and displays it on the screen.\n",

    "## 62.1 Introduction:\n",
    "### Chapter 62 focuses on image manipulation and enhancement techniques using NumPy. NumPy provides powerful array manipulation capabilities that can be leveraged to modify and enhance images. This chapter covers various operations such as resizing, cropping, rotating, adjusting brightness and contrast, and applying filters to improve the visual quality of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 62.2 Resizing Images:\n",
    "### NumPy allows for resizing images by manipulating the dimensions of the image array. The numpy.resize() function or the numpy.ndarray.resize() method can be used to resize images. Resizing can be performed by specifying the desired dimensions or by scaling the image by a certain factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 62.3 Cropping Images:\n",
    "### Image cropping involves selecting a specific region of interest from an image. NumPy's array indexing can be used to extract a specific portion of the image array, effectively cropping the image. By specifying the coordinates or the boundaries of the desired region, you can obtain a cropped version of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 62.4 Rotating Images:\n",
    "### NumPy provides functions for rotating images, allowing you to change the orientation of an image. The numpy.rot90() function or the numpy.ndarray.transpose() method can be used to rotate images by 90 degrees or to transpose the image array. For more complex rotations, you can utilize affine transformation matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 62.5 Adjusting Brightness and Contrast:\n",
    "### NumPy allows for adjusting the brightness and contrast of images. By manipulating the pixel values of the image array, you can change the overall brightness or enhance the contrast. This can be achieved by applying simple arithmetic operations or by using NumPy's built-in functions such as numpy.clip().\n",
    "\n",
    "## 62.6 Filtering and Enhancement:\n",
    "### NumPy enables the application of filters and enhancement techniques to improve the visual quality of images. You can use convolution operations to apply filters like Gaussian, median, or edge detection filters.

    "# Chapter 63: Image Filtering and Convolution with NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "## 63.1 Introduction:\n",
    "### Chapter 63 focuses on image filtering and convolution techniques using NumPy. Image filtering is a fundamental operation in image processing that involves modifying the pixel values of an image to enhance certain features or remove noise. NumPy provides powerful array manipulation functions that can be leveraged for efficient image filtering using convolution operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 63.2 Convolution Operation:\n",
    "### The convolution operation is the core concept behind image filtering. It involves sliding a small matrix, called a kernel or filter, over the image and performing element-wise multiplication and summation to obtain a filtered output. The kernel determines the specific filtering operation, such as blurring, sharpening, edge detection, or noise removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 63.3 Implementing Convolution with NumPy:\n",
    "### NumPy provides the numpy.convolve() function to perform convolution operations on 1-dimensional arrays. However, for image filtering, we need to perform 2-dimensional convolutions. NumPy's numpy.convolve() function can be extended to handle 2-dimensional convolutions by applying it to each color channel of the image or by using NumPy's numpy.convolve2d() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 63.4 Applying Filters:\n",
    "### To apply filters to images, we need to define the filter kernel. The kernel is a small matrix that contains the filter coefficients. NumPy allows us to define custom filter kernels or use predefined filter kernels such as the Gaussian, Sobel, or Laplacian filters. We convolve the filter kernel with the image using the convolution operation to obtain the filtered output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 63.5 Example: Image Filtering with NumPy:\n",
    "### Let's consider an example of image filtering using convolution with NumPy:\n",
    "\n",

    "# Load image using NumPy\n",
    "image = plt.imread('image.jpg')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define filter kernel\n",
    "filter_kernel = np.array([[0, -1, 0], [-1, 5, -1], [0, -1, 0]])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform convolution using scipy.signal.convolve2d\n",
    "filtered_image = np.zeros_like(image)\n",
    "for i in range(3):\n",
    "    filtered_image[:,:,i] = convolve2d(image[:,:,i], filter_kernel, mode='same', boundary='symm')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the original and filtered images\n",
    "fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5))\n",
    "axes[0].imshow(image)\n",

    "### In this example, we load an image file called \"image.jpg\" using NumPy's plt.imread() function. We define a filter kernel as a 3x3 matrix. We then apply the filter kernel to each color channel of the image using the scipy.signal.convolve2d() function. The resulting filtered image is displayed alongside the original image using Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 63.6 Conclusion:\n",
    "### NumPy provides powerful tools for image filtering and convolution operations. By leveraging NumPy's array manipulation capabilities and the convolve2d() function from the SciPy library, you can efficiently apply various filters to images. This allows for noise reduction, edge detection, image enhancement, and other important image processing tasks. Understanding and implementing convolution with NumPy is key to mastering image filtering techniques.\n",

    "### In this example, we load an image file called \"image.jpg\" using NumPy's plt.imread() function. We then perform superpixel segmentation using the SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) algorithm provided by the scikit-image library. The resulting segments are assigned unique labels. We create a binary mask for a specific segment by selecting a label value. Finally, we display the segmented image and the segment mask using Matplotlib.\n",

    "## 67.1 Introduction:\n",
    "## Chapter 67 covers memory-mapped arrays in NumPy. Memory-mapped arrays provide a way to map large arrays directly to disk files, allowing you to work with data that exceeds the available memory capacity. This technique can be especially useful when dealing with large datasets that cannot fit entirely into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 67.2 Memory Mapping Basics:\n",
    "### Memory mapping involves creating a virtual memory map that points to a physical file on disk. Instead of loading the entire array into memory, memory-mapped arrays allow you to access and manipulate specific portions of the array as needed, while the data is transparently read from or written to the disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 67.3 Creating Memory-Mapped Arrays:\n",
    "### NumPy provides the numpy.memmap() function to create memory-mapped arrays. You need to specify the file name, data type, shape, and access mode for the memory-mapped array. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "import numpy as np\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 67.4 Accessing and Manipulating Memory-Mapped Arrays:\n",
    "### Memory-mapped arrays can be accessed and manipulated like regular NumPy arrays. You can perform operations such as indexing, slicing, and mathematical computations on memory-mapped arrays. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",

    "## 67.5 Advantages of Memory-Mapped Arrays:\n",
    "### Memory-mapped arrays offer several advantages, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling large datasets: Memory-mapped arrays enable working with large datasets that cannot fit entirely into memory.\n",
    "#### Efficiency: Memory mapping allows for accessing and manipulating data on disk without the need to load the entire array into memory, resulting in more efficient memory utilization.\n",
    "#### Persistence: Changes made to memory-mapped arrays are persisted to disk, making it possible to resume working with the data at a later time.\n",
    "## 67.6 Limitations and Considerations:\n",
    "### While memory-mapped arrays provide flexibility and efficiency, there are some limitations and considerations to keep in mind:\n",

    "#### Disk I/O: Accessing data from disk incurs I/O overhead, which can affect the performance compared to in-memory operations.\n",
    "#### File size: Memory-mapped arrays are limited by the available disk space, so it's important to ensure sufficient disk space for the mapped file.\n",
    "#### Data synchronization: When multiple processes or threads access the same memory-mapped array simultaneously, proper synchronization mechanisms should be implemented to avoid conflicts.\n",
    "# 67.7 Closing Memory-Mapped Arrays:\n",
    "## Once you are done working with a memory-mapped array, it's important to explicitly close it to release system resources. This can be done by calling the close() method on the memory-mapped array. Here's an example:\n",
